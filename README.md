# Practice JSON and Javascript

## 11/28/24

## Description

Just a simple project. I will create a webpage version of a C# project (Restaurant Picker).
The following are details from the project.

- Allow the user to choose a category
- Displays Randomly Generated Restaurant.
- Must have at least 3 categories and 10 restaurants per category
- Should ask user if they would like to choose again

Additional changes to the original project will be below.

- Categories should be selected from a dropdown menu
- Create a button to generate restaurant
- The three categories and ten restaurants should be stored as objects in a json file
- The message promting user to choose again should be chil element that is created AFTER the restaurant is generated.
  - Existing tags containing text shouldn't be altered. An entirely new tag should be created and appended using JS
